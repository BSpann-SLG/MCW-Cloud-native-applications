# Cloud-native applications before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Overview

Before the hands-on lab, you will need to prepare the environment by deploying the database and the application locally on a virtual machine using Docker and MongoDB. You will also need to fork the GitHub repository containing the lab to your own GitHub account to be able to setup the CI/CD pipeline.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

   - To complete this lab setup, ensure your account includes the following:

     - Has the [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) built-in role for the subscription you use.

     - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)

   - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in [Task 5: Deploy ARM Template](#Task-5-Deploy-ARM-Template). You'll need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, more if you choose additional agents or larger VM sizes. Execute the steps required before the lab to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. An account in Microsoft [GitHub](https://github.com).

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

   - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

4. You will be asked to install other tools throughout the exercises.

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time as some of these steps take time.

### Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell

1. Open a cloud shell by selecting the cloud shell icon in the menu bar.

   ![The cloud shell icon is highlighted on the menu bar.](media/b4-image35.png "Cloud Shell")

2. The cloud shell opens in the browser window. Choose **Bash** if prompted or use the left-hand dropdown on the shell menu bar to choose **Bash** from the dropdown (as shown). If prompted, select **Confirm**.

   ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Bash was selected.](media/b4-image36.png "Cloud Shell Bash Window")

3. You should make sure to set your default subscription correctly. To view your current subscription type:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account show has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image37.png "Bash Shell AZ Account Show")

4. If the subscription that is displayed in the previous step is not the subscription you plan on using for this workshop, you will need to set the current subscription to your desired subscription. To set your default subscription to something other than the current selection, type the following, replacing {id} with the desired subscription id value:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

   > **Note**: If you do not know the id of your desired subscription, you can list the subscriptions available to you along with their ids via the following command:

   ```bash
   az account list
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account list has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image38.png "Bash AZ Account List")

### Task 2: Download Starter Files

> **Note**: You will need access to your Azure subscription via Azure Cloud Shell to proceed further in the workshop.  If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell) for setup instructions.

1. Check out the starter files from the MCW Cloud native applications Github repository and detach it from the existing remote repository via the following commands.

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone \
      --depth 1 \
      --branch main \
      https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cloud-native-applications.git \
      MCW-Cloud-native-applications
   cd MCW-Cloud-native-applications
   ```

   > **Note**: If you do not have enough free space, you may need to remove extra files from your cloud shell environment.  Try running `azcopy jobs clean` to remove any `azcopy` jobs and data you do not need.

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, git clone has been typed and run at the command prompt. The output from git clone is shown.](media/b4-2019-09-30_21-25-06.png "Bash Git Clone")

### Task 3: Setup Azure Cloud Shell Environment

1. Set the following environment variables in an Azure Cloud Shell terminal. Set up of Azure resources and lab repository require these environment variables. A Github personal access token with appropriate permissions is required to set up and complete this lab - [Click here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GitHub%20Secrets%20CLI) to quickly set up a Github personal access token with the required permissions.

   ```bash
   export MCW_SUFFIX=<SUFFIX>                   # Needs to be a unique three letter string
   export MCW_GITHUB_USERNAME=<GITHUB USERNAME> # Your Github account username
   export MCW_GITHUB_TOKEN=<GITHUB PAT>         # A personal access token for your Github account
   ```

   > Note: The following environment variables can also be set if their defaults are not appropriate for the lab setting or environment.

      - MCW_PRIMARY_LOCATION - Defaults to `westus`
      - MCW_PRIMARY_LOCATION_NAME - Defaults to `West US`
      - MCW_SECONDARY_LOCATION - Defaults to `eastus`
      - MCW_SECONDARY_LOCATION_NAME - Defaults to `East US`

2. Run the `create_azure_resources.sh` script in the `MCW-Cloud-native-applications` repository that was cloned in a previous step.

   ```bash
   cd ~/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/Hands-on\ lab/lab-files/developer/scripts
   bash create_azure_resources.sh
   ```

3. Upon successful execution of the `create_azure_resources.sh` script, a command for establishing an SSH session to the build agent VM should be present in the output.

   ```bash
   Command to create an active session to the build agent VM:

       ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@<PUBLIC IP OF VM>
   ```

4. Use the SSH command output in the previous step to establish an SSH session to the build agent VM.  You should be presented with a prompt similar to the following:

   `adminfabmedical@fabmedical-SUFFIX:~$`

   ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@52.174.141.11 has been typed and run at the command prompt. The information detailed above appears in the window.](media/b4-image27.png "Azure Cloud Shell Connect to Host")

### Task 4: Complete the build agent setup

1. From an Azure Cloud Shell terminal, use the SSH command output from the previous task and start an active SSH session to the build agent VM.

2. Clone the Fabmedical Github repository created in the previous task.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/Fabmedical
   ```

3. Run the script to set up the build agent VM environment.

   ```bash
   cd ~/Fabmedical/scripts
   bash create_build_environment.sh
   ```

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.
